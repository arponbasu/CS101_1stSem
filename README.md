# CS101_1stSem
This repository contains the very first programs I ever wrote, mainly as assignments to our programming course (CS101) in the first semester, in C++, and some programs which I wrote on my own, in C.

The zip folders are if you directly want to download the code (without forking the entire repository), the normal folders are if you just want to view the code.
